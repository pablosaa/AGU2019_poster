%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

* Microwave radiometry has become a common tool for estimation of profiles of atmospheric parameters. With a high temporal resolution radiometers are an alternative to standard methods like radiosondes.

* However remote sensing radiometry requires the use of retrieval algorithms. Some state-of-the-art methods like linear-, quadratic-regression or Neural Network are widely used by manufactures [3].

The present study assessts the uncertainty of those methods. Additionally two alternative inversion techniques are used: Bayesian (BAY) and Maximum Likelihood (MLE) inversion. Uncertainties are estimated from state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms provided by the HATPRO radiometer (RPG) firmware version 8.78 [3].

To estimate the uncertainties resulting from the algorithms, synthetic radiometer data have been created by radiative transfer simulations using radiosonde profiles [4] as descriptor of atmospheric states. These synthetic observations are arranged to mimic radiometer's firmware binary files. Thus letting the radiometer performs retrievals as with real data, but with the advantage of knowing the original profile. Absolute errors were assesed from retrieval results relative to the input profile to characterize the algorithms.

State-of-the-art retrieving methods by radiometer manufactures are:\\
\colouredcircle \hspace{2em} Linear (k=1)/quadratic (k=2) regression as [3]:
\[
	RP_{out}(i) = a_0(i) + \sum_{f}^{freq}a_{fk}(i)*TB^k_f(\theta)+\sum_{h}^{sensor}b_{h}*SE_h
\]
with $TB_f$ measured brightness temperature at frequency $f$ and angle $\theta$ and $SE_h$ surface sensors. $RP_{out}(i)$ is the retrieved parameter.\\
\colouredcircle \hspace{2em} Neural Networks [3]:
\[
	\overrightarrow{RP}_{out} = \mathbf{IM}*\overrightarrow{TB}
\]
where $\mathbf{IM}$ is the neural network coefficient matrix trained by the manufacturer.\\
{\large This work developed alternative retrievals based on:}\\
\colouredcircle \hspace{2em} Bayesian inversion [2,1]: PDF of atmospheric parameter $\vec{x}$ given the measurements matrix $\mathbf{TB}(f,\theta)$
\[
	P(\vec{x}|\mathbf{TB}) \sim P(\mathbf{TB}|\vec{x})*P(\vec{x})
\]
\[
	P(\mathbf{TB}|\vec{x}) = (2\pi)^{-\frac{1}{2}k} |\mathbf{\Sigma}|^{-\frac{1}{2}} exp(-\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{TB}_{sim}-\mathbf{TB}_o)^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{TB}_{sim}-\mathbf{TB}_o))
\]
with $TB_o$, $TB_{sim}$ and $\Sigma$ the brightness temperature measured, simulated and covariance matrix. The estimated parameter is given by the expected value from the \textit{posteriori} PDF
\[
	<\vec{x}> = \int P(\vec{x}|\mathbf{TB})\, \vec{x}\, d\vec{x}\quad \mbox{   and,   }\qquad \sigma^2_{\vec{x}}=\int P(\vec{x}|\mathbf{TB})[<\vec{x}>-\vec{x}]^2\,d\vec{x}
\]
\colouredcircle \hspace{2em} The Maximum Likelihood [1]: given the log-likelihood function\\
\[
	\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{TB}|\vec{x}) = -log(|\mathbf{\Sigma}|)-(\mathbf{TB}_{sim}-\mathbf{TB}_o)^T\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}(\mathbf{TB}_{sim}-\mathbf{TB}_o)-k\,log(\pi)
\]
solving for $\vec{x}$ that maximize $\mathcal{L}$ the retrieval is found by 
\[
	\frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{TB}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{TB}|\vec{x}_{max})= 0\quad
\]
with $\vec{x}_{max}$ being the MLE for the parameter $\vec{x}$.

{\small Advantages of Bayesian and Likelihood inversion:\\
* To customize an \textit{a-priori} dataset suited for specific climatologies [4],\\
* BAY and MLE use the same \textit{a-priori} to perform retrievals simultaneously,\\
* Synergistic observations from other instruments can be included to increase retrieval capabilities.\\
The retrievals performance are based on synthetic brightness temperatures, hence instrument calibration/systematic errors are not considered.\\
We found the MLE method better to retrieve temperature while BAY is better for humidity profiles. However Bayesian is found to be more sensitive to observation line-of-sight misalignments, where the RPG firmware shows to be less affected.}

%		It has been found that Bayesian inversion is able to more accurately reproduce the profiles vertical structure in contrast to the firmware retrieval methods. This is primary true for the case of humidity and temperature profiles.
%		%Moreover cases of synergy with a wind profiler are applied to the Bayesian scheme producing a consistent temperature, humidity and lower atmosphere wind shears simultaneously.
%		
%		The presented methodology for ground-based atmospheric profiling produces results resembling observations by radiosondes when a suitable a-priori dataset is used. Moreover the open source tools needed to produce the a-priori dataset for the Bayesian inversion is available on to be used by the scientific community.
